 During the infosys springboard internship Team 4 of Batch 4 developed the Smart Store Inventory Optimization system
to analyze product sales, track inventory performance, and predict future demand using Python. 
The project includes data cleaning, visualizations, 
regression-based forecasting, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. It helps retailers reduce stockouts, avoid overstocking, and make smarter inventory decisions.
